Welcome to CleanMARL documentation!
===================================

CleanMARL provides single file implementations of Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 
Moreover, it provides an educational resource to learn about multi-agent reinforcement learning. 
In a nutshell this project is a combination of `CleanRL <https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl>`_ 
and `Spinning Up in Deep RL <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_ but for **multi-agent RL**.




.. note::

   This project is under active development.
