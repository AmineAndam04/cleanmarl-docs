Welcome to CleanMARL documentation!
===================================

   
CleanMARL provides single file implementations of Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms. 
In addition, it serves as an **educational resource** for learning the algorithms and implementations of MARL. 
In a nutshell this project is a combination of `CleanRL <https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl>`_ 
and `Spinning Up in Deep RL <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_ but for **multi-agent RL**.




Github repository: https://github.com/AmineAndam04/cleanmarl


Main Features
-------------
- Implementations of key MARL algorithms: VDN, QMIX, COMA, MADDPG, FACMAC, IPPO, and MAPPO.
- A documentation for algorithms, code and training details. 
- We support parallel environments and recurrent policies. 
- Tensorboard and Weights & Biases logging.
